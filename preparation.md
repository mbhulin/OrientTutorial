# Preparation
In this tutorial you will work with the database management system **OrientDB**. You will learn how to access an OrientDB database inside of a JAVA program. Therefore you need access to an OrientDB server and - for convenience - an IDE (integrated development environment) like **Eclipse** for developing JAVA programs. If you prefer another IDE e.g. Netbeans you can use that one as well.

So you should do the following tasks before you start with this tutorial:
1. **Install OrientDB** on your computer. Read the **OrientDB documentation** to find out how to [install OrientDB](http://orientdb.com/docs/last/orientdb.wiki/Tutorial-Installation.html) on your computer. There is also a video lecture available at [Udemi](https://www.udemy.com/orientdb-getting-started/) (it is free but you must sign up before you can access the course). [Lecture 2](https://www.udemy.com/orientdb-getting-started/#/lecture/1726182) explains the installation process for different operating systems.
2. **Install Eclipse** and a JDK (Java Development Kit). The installation process is explained in this [Eclipse-wiki](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse/Installation). There are also a lot of YouTube videos available which explain the installation process.
