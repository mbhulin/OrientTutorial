# Fill the Database with Test Data
To keep this tutorial simple we do not develop a sophisticated user interface to draw rooms, walls, doors, windows etc. We  fill the database with static data of a sample apartment instead.

Execute the following steps:
* Inside of your Eclipse project *RobotWorldModel* create a new package *startApplications*.
* Download the file FillDB.java
* Import this file into the package *startApplications*.
* Start the OrientDB Server on your computer
