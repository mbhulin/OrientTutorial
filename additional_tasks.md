.
* Create a Java class ``ObjectTests.java`` with unit tests for the OrientDB classes *Object*, *ObjectConcept*, *IS_A*, *IS_PART_OF* and *PROB_IS_AT*.
* Develop the Schema for *Property*, *PropertyConcept* and *HAS_PROPERTY* as described in [Motivation](motivation.md). Then add intructions to ``CreateDBSchema.java`` which create these OrientDB classes.
