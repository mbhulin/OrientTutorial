# OrientDB Graph Database: Tutorial for the Java API
## World-Model for Autonomous Service Robots using the Graph-Database OrientDB
In this tutorial you will learn how to use **OrientDB** as a **Graph Database**. You will write **Java code** and use the **Java API** to access and control the database. This tutorial covers two alternatives to access the database:
* Navigation using [Tinkerpop Blueprints](https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki) framework
* Declarative access using the **SQL** dialect of OrientDB

The tutorial is based on a real world application: A service robot should help elderly or disabled persons in their household. To do so it must have knowledge about rooms and objects in its environment. A graph database like OrientDB is ideally suited to store this world model because the database is a highly connected graph.

You will need about three hours for the whole tutorial. You can read all explanations as text but also watch screen-cast videos.
