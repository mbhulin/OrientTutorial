# OrientDB Tutorial
## World-Model for Autonomous Service Robots using the Graph-Database OrientDB
In this tutorial you will learn how to use OrientDB as a graph database. You will write Java code and use the Java API to access and control the database. The tutorial is based on a real world application: A service robot should help elderly or disabled persons in their household. To do so it must have knowledge about rooms and objects in its environment. A graph database like OrientDB is ideally suited to store this world model because the database is a highly connected graph.
